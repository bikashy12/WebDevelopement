This is the third live session on Node Basics.
Today's session is about Streams concept.
This concept is about handling the large amount of data in more efficient way. 
Traditional way is of Buffering technique which loads entire file or data in one go in memory which also 
takes significant amount of space. Since the data is large response also get delay.
Using Streams we read and write data in small chunks increasing response time and saving memory space.
